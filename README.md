# wiebetaaltwat web app

A clojure program that calculates a balance of a group of people who spend money in an event. 
Functionally it's a clone of 'wiebetaaltwat.nl'. Doesn't deal with form inputs, just parses an input file.

Built for fun, as a way to learn (web development in) Clojure.

## Usage

It's just a compojure app, so, use `lein repl`, then `(use 'wiebetaaltwat-web.repl)`, then `(start-server)`
